/* Create a reasonably complicated Object in JavaScript that contains attributes and methods for the Motel customer. 
The customer attributes should include (and not be limited to), the customerâ€™s name`, birth date`, gender`, and room preferences` (as an array), payment method`, mailing address (as a sub-object)`, phone number`, check-in', and check-out' date (as a sub-object), and object methods` to determine their age' and duration of stay'.
The JavaScript code should also create a template literal string, or properly formatted html, that describes the customer. In other words, writes a paragraph describing the customer with many of their personal attributes dynamically embedded in the string / html coming from the above object definition. */
