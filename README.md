# qap4-files-zc
GitHub Repository for Keyin College's QAP4.

PYTHON: The Alt version of the script was the original version of the script, not quite what the QAP had in mind. The non-Alt version of the script has been modified to be more in-line with the QAP. I kept the Alt version because I think it's a neat take on the program.

JAVASCRIPT: A very simple program intended to get a feel for JavaScript.

ERD: Collaborators are Zachary Collier, Sarah Murphy, and Kyle / Scarlett Budgell. Program used is draw.io as it is easy enough to use.
